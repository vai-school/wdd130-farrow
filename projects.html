                    <ul>
                        <li>The Problem: Ice is difficult to transport and melts too easy</li>
                        <li>My Process: All I had to do was give the ice sunscreen so it didn't melt in the sun. It was simple really.</li>
                        <li>The Challenges: Sunscreen tastes bad so I had to product test differnet types to find the tasty kind</li>
                        <li>Tech Used: SPF50 Sunscreen, Ice</li>

                            <li>The Problem: When it takes more than a min </li>
                            <li>My Process: I combined a toaster with a wormhole generator purchesed on ebay. 
                                All it took was aligning the flux coils with the toster coils and I could start toast anytime and send it to myself as soon as I woke up</li>
                            <li>The Challenges: A temporal glitch caused the toaster to briefly become my own grandfather. After debugging the paradox loop, I restored the toaster to its proper function and timeline.</li>
